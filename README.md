# My-first- project1
# I tried to use all the tags making my first project. I woke up at 7:30 am and at 8:01AM I read the project and started working on it. At 10AM I was marked off absent today. I did a lot of git remote but not all went through.
# I got stuck and I couldnt work on css and when I tried to remote and push it wasn't working.
# I don't think I linked to github correctly. I'll continue to work on it and try to figure out what I did wrong.
